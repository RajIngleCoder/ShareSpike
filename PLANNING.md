# ShareSpike Planning Document

## Project Vision
ShareSpike is a Shopify app designed to boost sales by rewarding customers who share products on Instagram. When a customer shares a product, the app verifies the share and automatically applies a discount, creating a viral marketing loop that benefits both merchants and customers.

## Goals & Objectives
- Drive viral marketing through customer-led social sharing
- Increase sales and customer engagement for Shopify merchants
- Provide analytics to measure ROI on social sharing discounts
- Scale to thousands of Shopify stores

## Architecture
### Frontend
- **Approach**: React with Shopify App Bridge for embedding in Shopify Admin
- **Routing**: Next.js App Router for efficient page navigation
- **UI**: Shopify Polaris components for admin-embedded UI consistency
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for additional custom styling

### Backend
- **Framework**: Node.js with Express
- **API Integration**: Shopify API library for OAuth and API interactions
- **Authentication**: Shopify OAuth for secure store access

### Database
- **Provider**: Supabase
- **Storage**: 
  - Share verification data
  - Discount code tracking
  - Analytics information

### External APIs
- **Shopify Admin API**: For product data, discount creation, and sales tracking
- **Instagram Graph API**: For verifying customer shares via mentions

## User Workflows

### Merchant Workflow
1. Install ShareSpike from Shopify App Store
2. Configure discount settings (percentage, eligible products)
3. Customize share verification requirements
4. Review analytics dashboard to track ROI
5. Adjust settings based on performance metrics

### Customer Workflow
1. Share product on Instagram, mentioning the store
2. Submit share evidence through the app's frontend
3. System verifies the share via Instagram API
4. Customer receives automatic discount code
5. Customer applies discount to purchase

## Technical Constraints
- Must adhere to Shopify's API rate limits
- Instagram API access requires customer Facebook authorization
- Share verification must be secure to prevent fraud
- App must maintain performance even with high verification volume

## Coding Standards

### General Principles
- Functional and declarative programming patterns
- Avoid classes, prefer function components
- Modularize code to avoid duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs

### File Structure
- Routes organized by feature domain
- Components follow the atomic design system
- Utilities separated by concern (API, authentication, etc.)

### UI/UX Standards
- Use Shopify Polaris components for admin-embedded UI consistency
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Optimize loading states and error handling

### Performance Optimization
- Minimize client-side code
- Leverage server components where possible
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Optimize API calls to reduce latency

## Security Considerations
- Secure API key storage in environment variables
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Validate all user inputs
- Follow Shopify's security best practices

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core business logic
- Integration tests for API interactions
- End-to-end tests for critical user workflows
- Manual testing in development stores

## Deployment & Infrastructure
- Continuous integration via GitHub Actions
- Deployment to Vercel or Heroku
- Monitoring with appropriate logging
- Regular backups of critical data

## Future Expansion Possibilities
- Support for additional social media platforms
- Advanced discount rules based on engagement metrics
- Integration with email marketing platforms
- AI-powered share verification
